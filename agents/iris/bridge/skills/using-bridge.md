name: using-bridge
description: Use when any Bridge command is invoked (make, fix, done, setup, drop, status) or any Figma / design-system / compiler / Bridge workflow topic is raised. Sets command priorities and iron laws (compiler-only, semantic tokens only, verification-before-ship).

# Using Bridge

Bridge is a **compiler-driven** design workflow for generating Figma designs
and maintaining a design system via Claude Code. The compiler (at
`lib/compiler/compile.ts`) enforces all 26 Figma Plugin API rules, so Claude
NEVER writes raw Plugin API code and NEVER hardcodes primitive values.

This skill is **force-loaded at every SessionStart** via `hooks/session-start`.
Its job is to establish the discipline before any action skill runs. It is
deliberately small (~400 tokens) to keep the fixed per-session cost low.

## Command Map

| User intent (keywords)                                         | Route to                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| "make", "design", "create", "build", "generate", "new component", "new screen" | `generating-figma-design`         |
| "fix", "correct", "learn", "diff", "what changed", "I adjusted" | `learning-from-corrections`       |
| "done", "ship", "ship it", "finish", "complete"                 | `shipping-and-archiving`          |
| "setup", "setup bridge", "extract", "extract DS", "onboard", "initialize", "bootstrap" | `extracting-design-system`        |
| "drop", "abandon", "cancel"                                     | inline `Drop Procedure` (this skill) |
| "status", "what's next", "workflow"                             | inline status logic (this skill)  |

## Drop Procedure (inline)

`drop` is handled inline here — it is small enough not to warrant its
own skill. Invoke when the user says "drop", "abandon", or "cancel".

1. **Confirm.** Ask: "Sure you want to drop {name}?"
2. **Capture learnings.** If a snapshot exists, offer to run `fix` first to
   capture corrections before archiving.
3. **Document drop reason.** Append a `drop:` block to the CSpec with
   `date`, `reason`, and `learnings`.
4. **Archive.** Move `specs/active/{name}.cspec.yaml` →
   `specs/dropped/{name}.cspec.yaml`. Move the snapshot JSON too if it
   exists.
5. **Update history.** Append `{ISO date} | {name} | DROPPED | {reason}`
   to `specs/history.log`.
6. **Cleanup.** Remove `/tmp/bridge-scene-{name}.json` if present.

Output template:

    ## Dropped: {name}

    Reason: {reason}
    CSpec archived: specs/dropped/{name}.cspec.yaml
    Learnings: {captured | skipped}

    Ready for the next design. Run: `make <description>`.

## Skill Priority

1. **Process first, then action.** For exploratory or ambiguous requests,
   brainstorm the intent first before implementing. For a clear directive
   that maps to a command in the table above, route directly.
2. **Verification before completion.** No "done" without evidence
   (see Iron Laws below).
3. **Minimal context.** Load only the references needed for the current
   action. See each action skill's `## Verification` section.

---

## Iron Laws (non-negotiable)

<IRON-LAW>
NEVER write raw Figma Plugin API code. All scene graph JSON must pass through `lib/compiler/compile.ts`. Violations require explicit human approval before any execution to Figma.
</IRON-LAW>

<IRON-LAW>
NEVER use hardcoded primitive values. Only semantic DS tokens (`$color/...`, `$spacing/...`, `$text/...`, `$comp/...`). The compiler emits `RESOLVE_TOKEN_NOT_FOUND` for any unresolved reference.
</IRON-LAW>

<IRON-LAW>
NEVER claim "done" without: (a) compiler exit 0, (b) screenshot taken in this turn, (c) user confirmation of visual correctness. "Looks right" / "should pass" / "I'm confident" are forbidden — show the evidence.
</IRON-LAW>

<IRON-LAW>
NEVER read `figma-api-rules.md`. The compiler enforces all 26 rules. This file does not exist in v6.
</IRON-LAW>

<IRON-LAW>
NEVER reuse a Figma `nodeId` from a previous session. Node IDs are session-scoped — re-search.
</IRON-LAW>

## Red Flags — Rationalization → Reality

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll just hardcode this hex once" | Always use a semantic token. No exceptions. |
| "The compiler is overkill for this tiny thing" | The compiler is the only path. |
| "Skip the screenshot, it's obviously right" | 'Looks right' ≠ 'is right'. |
| "I remember this nodeId from my last session" | Node IDs are session-scoped. Re-search. |
| "I'll use figma-api-rules.md for context" | That file is forbidden. Compiler owns all rules. |
| "The user approved, I can skip the compile exit code check" | Compile exit 0 is Gate A. Independent of user approval. |
| "Let me write a small inline Plugin API script for this fix" | No inline scripts. Scene graph → compiler → execute. |

## Conversation Language Rule

- **Conversation** with the user: their language (detect from context).
- **All generated artifacts** (KB files, CSpecs, guides, learnings, recipes,
  scene graphs, docs, specs, plans): **English only**. This rule is
  non-negotiable per Bridge's artifact policy.
